Task Management System
1. User Journey -- Which contains Login/ Register/ using Simple JWT Token (i.e ReFresh Token to provide a new token whenever a user logs in again)
2. A DashBoard which displays all elements of task list and we can change it accordingly
3. I have also added custom permissions init.
4. One can perform Create, View, Update and Delete operations on it.
